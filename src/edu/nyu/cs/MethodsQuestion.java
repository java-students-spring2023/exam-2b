    /**
     * bmiCalc
     * Complete a method named bmiCalc that calculates a person's body mass index (BMI), 
     * and determines whether that person's weight is categorized by the US Centers for Disease Control as 
     * "underweight" (BMI < 18.5), "normal weight" (18.5 < BMI < 24.9), "overweight" (25 < BMI < 29.9), 
     * or "obese" (BMI >= 29.9).  
     * 
     * The formula for calculating BMI is as follows:
     *      BMI = (weight * 703) / (height)^2
     * 
     * @param height The person's height, in inches, as an int
     * @param weight The person's weight, in pounds, as an int
     * @return The user's CDC-approved BMI category, as a String (i.e. "underweight", "normal weight", "overweight", or "obese")

    /**
     * main
     * Complete a main method such that it asks the user for their height and weight and
     * calls the bmiCalc function defined above to calculate the user's CDC-approved weight category.
     * 
     * Requirements:
     * - Assume the user will respond appropriately to the questions with integer values.
     * 
     * An example session may look as follows/ Your program should follow the formatting of this output exactly.
     * (user responses are shown on the same line for ease-of-reading only):
     * 
     *      Height (inches): 66
     *      Weight (pounds): 156
     *      The CDC thinks you are overweight!
     * 
     * @param args An array of any command-line arguments.

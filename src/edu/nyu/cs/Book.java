/**
 * @author Your Name and Net ID Here
 * @version 0.1
 * 
 * Create a class that represents a Book, including some basic information about the book 
 * and an array of chapters of text, where each chapter is a String object.
 * 
 * Check the UML diagram for this class located in this repository's 'images' directory.
 * Your code must include the properties and methods indicated there.  Anything not 
 * indicated in the diagram or these instructions is left to your discretion.  You are free 
 * to add additional properties and/or methods, as necessary to meet the requirements.
 * 
 * Your code must include a constructor that accepts as arguments the values to assign to
 * each of the instance properties indicated in the UML diagram.  The order of the 
 * constructor's parameter must match the order in which the properties are listed in the 
 * UML diagram.
 * 
 * Your code must follow object-oriented best-practices:
 *  - all properties should be private, unless there is good reason otherwise.
 *  - getters and setters should be provided for access from external classes.
 *  - setters should perform meaningful validation to prevent nonsensical values.
 * 
 * In addition to defining the class here, complete the main method in the TestBook class.

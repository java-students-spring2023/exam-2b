     * studyManager
     * Complete a method named studyManager such that it uses a loop to ask a user 
     * how many hours they studied for each day of the week and prints out the total at the end.
     * 
     * Requirements:
     * - each iteration of the loop should ask about one day, using human-friendly sentences.  
     * - you can assume the user will always respond with a valid integer value
     * - once the loop has completed, the program should return the total number of hours studied.
     * 
     * An example session may look as follows. Your program should follow the formatting of this output exactly:
     * (user responses are shown on the same line for ease-of-reading only):
     * 
     *      How many hours did you study on Monday? 4
     *      How many hours did you study on Tuesday? 2
     *      How many hours did you study on Wednesday? 1
     *      How many hours did you study on Thursday? 6
     *      How many hours did you study on Friday? 9
     *      How many hours did you study on Saturday? 0
     *      How many hours did you study on Sunday? 1
     *      You studied a total of 23 hours this week.

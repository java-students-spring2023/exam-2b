/**
 * @author Your Name and Net ID Here
 * @version 0.1

 * Create a class named AudioBook that inherits from the Book class and makes use of 
 * the setup code in the parent class's constructor.  Whereas the Book class represents 
 * a printed paper book with chapters as String objects, the AudioBook represents each 
 * chapter as a byte array of audio data.  
 * 
 * Check the UML diagram for this class located in this repository's 'images' directory.
 * This diagram shows all inherited properties and methods (indicated with ^) as well as 
 * those that must be added or overridden.  Anything not indicated in the diagram or these 
 * instructions is left to your discretion.  You are free to add additional properties 
 * and/or methods, as necessary to meet the requirements.
 * 
 * Your code must include a constructor that accepts as arguments the values to assign to
 * each of the instance properties indicated in the UML diagram.  The order of the 
 * constructor's parameter must match the order in which the properties are listed in the 
 * UML diagram.
 * 
 * Your code must follow object-oriented best-practices:
 *  - all properties should be private, unless there is good reason otherwise.
 *  - getters and setters should be provided for access from external classes.
 *  - setters should perform meaningful validation to prevent nonsensical values.
 * 
 * In addition to defining the class here, complete the main method in the TestAudioBook class.

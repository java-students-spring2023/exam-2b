  * countMacaroni
  * Complete a method named countMacaroni such that it counts how many times the String, "macaroni" occurs within a given text.
  *
  * Requirements:
  * - you are NOT allowed to import any libraries or APIs to help solve this problem.
  * - use the String type's .indexOf(String searchTerm, int startIndex) method, which returns the position at which searchTerm is found within the string, starting from startIndex, or returns a -1 if searchTerm is not found within the string.
  * - the search for "macaroni" must be case insensitive.
  * - all occurrences of "macaroni" in the text count, irrespective of any spaces or other separators around it.
  * - for example, "macaroni foo bar Macaronimacaroni macaROnibomb" has 4 occurences for our purposes.
  *
  * @param text The text within which to perform a case-insensitive search for "macaroni"
  * @return The number of occurrences of the String, "macaroni" within the given text, as an integer.
